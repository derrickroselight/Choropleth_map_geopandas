# GeoPandas_Data_Viz
Geopandas is an excellent GIS package in python.  
It can produce aesthetic and informative choropleth map without any difficulty.  
The example is one of our opioids prescribing trend research in Taiwan, sponsored by our Ministry of Health and Welfare.  
The details pertain to the graph and the corresponding code are in the choropleth_map.py file.
